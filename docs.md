## DAY 1 | SATURDAY, 28 OCTOBER 2023

### GAME 1

---
* **TIME OF QUEUE:** 18:30
* **END OF GAME:** 18:42
* **MAP:** KOTH_LAZARUS
---

Started off rather mediocre with a half finished game with about 11 players in the server.
Not to mention that it was my first TF2 game in forever. There was only one bot in the 
server shortly after I joined, but it was kicked soon, thank god.

### GAME 2

---

* **TIME OF QUEUE:** 18:42
* **END OF GAME:** 18:56
* **MAP:** KOTH_SUIJIN

---

Round went way better than the previous, as it was a full match and the teams were somewhat 
balanced. Got some good frags, hit shots I didn't expect to hit, but I still need to work on 
how many shots I whiff.
Managed to piss of an enemy pyro whom decided to counter-snipe me, with little to no effect 
on my gameplay. He switched back to pyro as soon as he noticed that their team was getting 
their ass to them by ours.

### GAME 3

* **TIME OF QUEUE:** 19:00
* **END OF GAME:** 19:11
* **MAP:** KOTH_BADLANDS

Another fun match just like the last. Sadly it was a match that was already running when I 
joined, but I managed to make the most of it. Hit some gnarly shots, and even dominated one 
of the snipers on the enemy team. Sadly the game was slightly off balance due to the 
quantity of fresh installs on my team. We ended up pulling a victory on the round that I 
joined, but the second round we lost which sealed the deal.

Underwhelming, heavily onesided game. Had little chance for sniping due to the enemies 
practically spawncamping us.
