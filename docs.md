Started off rather mediocre with a half finished game with about 11 players in the server.
Not to mention that it was my first TF2 game in forever. There was only one bot in the server shortly after I joined, but it was kicked soon, thank god.

Round went way better than the previous, as it was a full match and the teams were somewhat balanced. Got some good frags, hit shots I didn't expect to hit, but I still need to work on how many shots I whiff.
Managed to piss of an enemy pyro whom decided to counter-snipe me, with little to no effect on my gameplay. He switched back to pyro as soon as he noticed that their team was getting their ass to them by ours.

Another fun match just like the last. Sadly it was a match that was already running when I joined, but I managed to make the most of it. Hit some gnarly shots, and even dominated one of the snipers on the enemy team. Sadly the game was slightly off balance due to the quantity of fresh installs on my team. We ended up pulling a victory on the round that I joined, but the second round we lost which sealed the deal.
